There are noticable differences between the Commerical utility use, notably electricity, during the COVID pandemic. In April 2020, a sharp decrease in commerical electricity use can be seen on the above chart. 

```{r}
pge_chart_res <- 
  pge_final_res %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b-%y") +
  geom_bar( 
    aes(
      x = DATE,
      y = TOTALKBTU,
      fill = CUSTOMERCLASS,
    ),
    stat = "identity",
    position = "stack"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "kBTU's",
    title = "PG&E Territory Monthly Residential Electricity and Gas Usage, 2017 to Present",
    fill = "Utility Type"
  )

```

In terms of residential electricity and gas use across the four analysis years, there was a slight increase as a result of the pandemic. This is reasonable as there were more people working and spending extra time at home. 

Key assumptions: It is assumed that the given CSV files obtained from the Pacific Gas and Electricity Company are accurate and representative of the actual trends.
